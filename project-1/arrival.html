  <h1>The Arrival hey</h1>
  <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary...</p>

  <p>The poem begins on a cold, dark night as the narrator, lost in sorrow over his lost love Lenore, hears a sudden tapping at his chamber door. Is it merely a visitor—or something more?</p>

  <h2>The Moment</h2>
  <p>At first, the tapping seems ordinary, yet it fills the narrator with unease. As he opens the door, he finds only darkness. But soon, the sound returns...</p>

  <h2>Key Lines</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>  
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>What Does It Mean?</h2>
  <p>The arrival of the mysterious tapping sets the stage for the eerie presence of the raven. Is it a real visitor, or a manifestation of the narrator’s own grief?</p>
