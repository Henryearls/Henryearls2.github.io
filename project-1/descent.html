  <h1>Descent Into Madness</h1>
  <p>The narrator’s mind begins to unravel as the tapping persists, and the mysterious raven makes its entrance. What was once a mere curiosity transforms into an obsession.</p>

  <h2>The Moment</h2>
  <p>The narrator, already lost in grief, watches as the raven perches upon a bust of Pallas Athena. He begins questioning the bird, but each inquiry is met with the same ominous reply: <strong>"Nevermore."</strong></p>

  <h2>Key Lines</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>  
    By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Quoth the Raven, ‘Nevermore.’”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>What Does It Mean?</h2>
  <p>The raven's repeated response seems at first like mere mimicry, but soon takes on a sinister meaning. The narrator projects his fears onto the bird, spiraling deeper into despair.</p>
