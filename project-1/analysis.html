  <h1>Reflection & Analysis</h1>
  <p>Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” is a masterpiece of Gothic literature, exploring themes of grief, loss, and madness. The poem’s haunting repetition and musicality create an atmosphere of inevitability—one where sorrow reigns supreme.</p>

  <h2>Themes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Grief and Loss:</strong> The narrator is mourning Lenore, his lost love, and searches desperately for meaning in his suffering.</li>
    <li><strong>Madness:</strong> As the poem progresses, the narrator spirals into irrationality, projecting his torment onto the raven.</li>
    <li><strong>Supernatural vs. Psychological Horror:</strong> Is the raven truly an omen, or is it a manifestation of the narrator’s descent into despair?</li>
    <li><strong>Inevitability of Death:</strong> The final “Nevermore” cements the idea that the narrator will never escape his sorrow.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Literary Devices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The word “Nevermore” is the poem’s refrain, growing in meaning and intensity with each iteration.</li>
    <li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> The raven represents death, fate, and the narrator’s inescapable grief.</li>
    <li><strong>Allusions:</strong> The mention of “Pallas” (Athena) suggests wisdom, contrasting with the narrator’s emotional instability.</li>
    <li><strong>Rhyme & Rhythm:</strong> The poem’s trochaic octameter gives it a hypnotic, incantatory quality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>“The Raven” endures as one of the most chilling explorations of human sorrow in literature. The narrator, trapped in his own mind, seeks solace but finds only confirmation of his worst fears. The raven itself may be a simple bird, but to the narrator, it becomes an eternal symbol of hopelessness.</p>
